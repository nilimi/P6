# Summary

Given the passenger data of the Titanic, I grouped the records by class and gender.  I calculated the survival rates for the different groups.  Surprised by clear relationship, I created a chart to display how survival rate was highest for first class and for women.

# Design

Design - explain any design choices you made including changes to the 
visualization after collecting feedback

I add two categories, 'Sex' and 'Passenger Class', to the x-axis and added a series for 'Passenger Class'.  I used 'Survival Rate' for the y-axis. I added a centered title and positioned the legend on the right side, clear of the chart.  I set the width and heigth of the svg to 700 and 400 respectively, after some experimenting with bl.ockly to see what size might display in the page without needing to open in its own page.

After feedback 1 regarding missing value 3 from legend, I changed the legend positioning from "90%", "5%", "5%", "10%" to "90%", "10%", "10%", "20%".

I centered the graph to align with the centered title.

Since there seemed to be some confusion with percentage, I changed the y-axis title to include "by Percentage".

There was also confusion about what the class numbers meant, so I changed the data to indicate "1st Class", "2nd Class" and "3rd Class" and changed the x-axis title to indicate "Passenger Class".

Overall, it seems my audience understood the story I was trying to tell.  Survival on the Titanic greatly depended on class and sex of the passenger.

## Feedback 1 from Udacity Forum

Great visualisation.

2)did 97% of female in class 1 survive?

>What relationships do you notice?<
3)Relationship between gender and survival and also class and survival could be seen.

>What do you think is the main takeaway from this graphic?< 
4)There is no much takeaway except for the legend used shows just 2 colors pclass 1 and 2.3 is missing.

>Is there something you don't understand in the graphic?<
5)The graph speaks what ever has to conveyed.

## Feedback 2 from Live Interview

>What did you notice about the visualization?<
That more women survived the Titanic then men.

>What questions do you have about the data?<
What seperates the classes?

>What do you think is the main takeaway from this graphic?< 
That the ones had a much better chance of survival.
That if you were a woman in group one , you would've been fine.

>Is there something you don't understand in the graphic?<
Explain what seperates the classes better.

## Feedback 3 from Live Interview

>What did you notice about the visualization?<
very understandable, eyecatching bar graph - good color variation, nice size

>What questions do you have about the data?<
Should children have been included?

>What relationships do you notice?<
There's an obvious correlation that economic class had bearing on survival decision making, on who they chose to save.

>What do you think is the main takeaway from this graphic?< 
Leaders and authorities (probably men) in this emergency thought it more important to save rich people; and their cultural mores had them
inclined to put females to safety before themselves.

>Is there something you don't understand in the graphic?<
The graph is very understandable.
